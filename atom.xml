Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.</p><p>However, editing visual content isn’t that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can’t be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.</p><p>If you want more decent editing, check out and click the download button right here:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Your Chromebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Android Video Editor Apps for Chromebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><hr><h2 id="Best-Online-Video-Editors-for-Chromebook-1"><a href="#Best-Online-Video-Editors-for-Chromebook-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Video Editors for Chromebook"></a>Best Online Video Editors for Chromebook</h2><p>In such abundance of different online video editors, most Chromebook owners will find themselves wondering, which online video editor is the best for me.

Still, there is no VLLO Mac version yet. Nor the vendor has indicated that there will be future releases for MacBook. But it does not mean that you cannot download the VLLO on Mac devices.</p><p>Scroll down to find out how to install VLLO on Mac and the best alternatives to VLLO for MacBook. The first part of the article discusses how to install VLLO on Mac, whereas the second part mentions the best alternatives to VLLO.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Download VLLO on Mac</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Download-VLLO-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-Download-VLLO-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Download VLLO on Mac"></a>Part 1: Download VLLO on Mac</h2><p>Given that the Macs come integrated with the dual-processor,quad-core, 6-core, and 8-core, you can utilize an emulator and run iOS or Android applications conveniently. Here are how to download VVLO on Mac devices:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download BlueStacks Emulator&#x2F;NoxPlayer</strong></p><p>You can download any of the two Emulators mentioned: BlueStack or NoxPlayer. To download NoxPlayer on Mac:</p><ul><li>Download the NoxPlayer emulator on Mac.</li><li>Run the software on your Mac and click Install.</li><li>Agree to terms and conditions of the application.</li><li>On the next page, you have to choose whether you want to utilize the online or offline platform. Choose Offline.</li><li>Once installed, the software will show on the Mac.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="download noxplayer"                ></p><p>Similar to this, you can also install BlueStack on Mac by visiting the official Bluestack page and selecting the Mac edition of the software.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Google Play</strong></p><ul><li>After installing any of the two emulators, choose Google folder</li><li>Then choose Google Play Store App</li><li>Sign in via the Google Account</li><li>Once you sign in successfully, you will see the same interface of the Google Play Store like the one you see on Android smartphones.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Install VLLO on Mac</strong></p><ul><li>To install VLLO on MacBook.</li><li>Go to search enter VLLO Video Editor</li><li>Click search icon</li><li>Hit Install</li><li>Confirm Install</li><li>Click Open.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-2.jpg"                      alt="install vllo"                ></p><p>There you go, you can now use the VLLO video editor on your MacBook. Of course, the application will not be that handy, but you have to consider the fact that the application is designed for smartphones, not computers. Still, the feature set remains the same, so it will be convenient if you have already used the application beforehand.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-VLLO-for-Mac-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-2-Best-VLLO-for-Mac-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives"></a>Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives</h2><p>Not impressed with VLLO and looking for alternatives? Well, here are the two best applications that have the capabilities to impress you. First on the list is among the most powerful video-editing tools on the internet, and second Apple’s own free program for Mac users. Read on to find which one is the best for you!</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora for Mac is recognized as the best <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >macOS video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software for beginners and intermediates in the industry. The reason: be it the interface, supported formats, features, or export options — the Filmora for Mac is superior in comparison to regular software.</p><p>The AI-backed interface is intuitive enough to allow even beginner-level video editors to utilize the application to the fullest; plus, it is powerful enough to impress expert video editors. Also, the software supports all video, audio, and image formats, so you do not have to waste your time with encoding before proceeding to edit the videos. Coming to the features — to sum up in brief — the Filmora for Mac contains all that is expected from video-editing software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Why should I use the Filmora for Mac instead of VLLO? Reasons:</strong></p><ul><li>Filmora has an intuitive, modern interface that makes things like rotating, merging, trimming, splitting, cropping, and flipping videos effortless and convenient for newbies, semi-pros, or pros.</li><li>The software is free to utilize</li><li>Auto-color and color correction options to tune your video exactly as you want</li><li>Easiest keyframing experience of any software; one-click options preset options to create custom animations</li><li>The application allows you to record a voiceover directly into your project timeline.</li><li>You can remove video noise from your footage.</li></ul><h3 id="2-iMovie"><a href="#2-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. iMovie</h3><p>Apple native iMovie is a simple and basic video editing tool that can well compete with the likes of VLLO. But there is a good reason to mention the application as the second in the list next to Filmora for Mac. And the reason: it is not as powerful, intuitive as Filmora for Mac. Mind you, iMovie includes all the basic features needed for everyday video editing. You can cut, split, trim, and apply filters, effects, and more. However, for the sake of the simple interface — Apple excluded important features like Timeline panel from the interface, giving you less control over the videos.</p><p>In all, the application is suitable for the users who do not need powerful editing features or take much control of what’s happening in the video. Still, given the fact that the application is free to utilize, it does not hurt to download the application and verify whether the application will suit your needs or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-3.jpg"                      alt="imovie"                ></p><p><strong>Why should I use iMovie instead of VLLO? Reasons:</strong></p><ul><li>First things first, iMovie interface will be much more convenient to the users on MacBook instead of the smartphone-type interface of the VLLO</li><li>The app has all the basic editing options needed to enrich the footage looks</li><li>Free to utilize application, no ads like VLLO</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>VLLO may be a great tool, but it is not the only application. As indicated, software tools like Wondershare Filmora for Mac are powerful, simple, and include features that allow you to videos like a professional within minutes. Whereas the iMovie is another simple option suitable mostly for typical users who only need basic options. But if you are serious about video editing or want to edit videos like a professional by tailoring every detail exactly like you want - Filmora for Mac is the way to go<img src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" alt="![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)"><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleash-your-creativity-the-best-free-wmv-video-editors/"><u>In 2024, Unleash Your Creativity The Best Free WMV Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/in-2024-vn-video-editor-pro-review-can-it-replace-your-go-to-video-editor/"><u>In 2024, VN Video Editor Pro Review Can It Replace Your Go-To Video Editor?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-cartoonization-apps-for-mobile-devices/"><u>New 2024 Approved Top 10 Cartoonization Apps for Mobile Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-windows-10-video-editors-the-best-free-and-paid-imovie-alternatives-for-2024/"><u>Updated Windows 10 Video Editors The Best Free and Paid iMovie Alternatives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-hidden-gems-free-speech-to-text-apps-for-mac-without-downloads/"><u>New In 2024, Top Hidden Gems Free Speech-to-Text Apps for Mac Without Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-spin-flip-and-rotate-the-top-online-video-rotation-services-for-2024/"><u>New Spin, Flip, and Rotate The Top Online Video Rotation Services for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-speed-up-your-storytelling-mastering-time-lapses-in-final-cut-pro-for-2024/"><u>New Speed Up Your Storytelling Mastering Time Lapses in Final Cut Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unleash-your-gopro-footage-a-quik-review-and-top-pc-video-editing-alternatives/"><u>Updated In 2024, Unleash Your GoPro Footage A Quik Review and Top PC Video Editing Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-list-of-whatsapp-status-video-creation-tools-free-and-paid/"><u>New In 2024, The Ultimate List of WhatsApp Status Video Creation Tools Free & Paid</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-are-you-finding-it-hard-to-use-final-cut-pro-to-match-colors-in-your-clips-read-this-tutorial-to-do-color-match-in-final-cut-pro-and-use-its-best-al/"><u>Updated Are You Finding It Hard to Use Final Cut Pro to Match Colors in Your Clips?

Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >split screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.</p><p>To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.</p><p>Try Filmora for Smartphone</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/mobile-download-redirect/badge-download-on-the-app-store.png"                                     ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/mobile-download-redirect/google-play-badge.png"                                     ></a></p><p>Try Filmora for iPad</p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1459336970?pt=169436&ct=mobiletraffic&mt=8"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/mobile-download-redirect/badge-download-on-the-app-store.png"                                     ></a></p><h3 id="1-iMovie"><a href="#1-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>This is Apple’s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering it’s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.</p><h3 id="2-PicPlay-Post-Movie-Video-Editor"><a href="#2-PicPlay-Post-Movie-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor"></a>2. PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS, Android</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost"                ></p><p>This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. It’s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.</p><h3 id="3-Video-Collage-and-Photo-Grid"><a href="#3-Video-Collage-and-Photo-Grid" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Collage and Photo Grid"></a>3. Video Collage and Photo Grid</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid"                ></p><p>The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.</p><h3 id="4-Split-Screen-Video"><a href="#4-Split-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Split Screen Video"></a>4. Split Screen Video</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> $2.99</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video"                ></p><p>With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.</p><h3 id="5-Perfect-Video-Editor-Collage"><a href="#5-Perfect-Video-Editor-Collage" class="headerlink" title="5. Perfect Video Editor, Collage"></a>5. Perfect Video Editor, Collage</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage"                ></p><p>There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.</p><h3 id="6-Vidstitch-Frames-for-Instagram"><a href="#6-Vidstitch-Frames-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="6 Vidstitch Frames for Instagram"></a>6 Vidstitch Frames for Instagram</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS, Android</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram"                ></p><p>You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although it’s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.</p><h3 id="7-Acapella"><a href="#7-Acapella" class="headerlink" title="7. Acapella"></a>7. Acapella</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS, Android</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella"                ></p><p>While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.</p><h3 id="8-Video-Merge-Side-by-Side"><a href="#8-Video-Merge-Side-by-Side" class="headerlink" title="8. Video Merge, Side by Side"></a>8. Video Merge, Side by Side</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> Android</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg"                      alt="Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side"                ></p><p>Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it can’t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.</p><h3 id="9-4xcamera"><a href="#9-4xcamera" class="headerlink" title="9. 4xcamera"></a>9. 4xcamera</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> iOS, Android</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.</p><h3 id="10-Multiple-Videos-at-Same-Time"><a href="#10-Multiple-Videos-at-Same-Time" class="headerlink" title="10. Multiple Videos at Same Time"></a>10. Multiple Videos at Same Time</h3><p><strong>Availability:</strong> Android</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. It’s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesn’t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.</p><h2 id="Make-Split-Screen-Videos-with-Templates-on-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Make-Split-Screen-Videos-with-Templates-on-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Make Split-Screen Videos with Templates on Wondershare Filmora"></a>Make Split-Screen Videos with Templates on Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>If you want to create a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >split-screen video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> footage on desktop, I recommend you Wondershare Filmora.

Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.</p><h2 id="Best-Free-and-Paid-Video-Collage-Apps-for-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#Best-Free-and-Paid-Video-Collage-Apps-for-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad"></a>Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad</h2><p>Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p><h4 id="1-Video-Collage-and-Photo-Grid"><a href="#1-Video-Collage-and-Photo-Grid" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Collage and Photo Grid"></a>1. Video Collage and Photo Grid</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 8 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg"                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad"                ></p><p>As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p><h4 id="2-PicPlayPost-Movie-Video-Editor"><a href="#2-PicPlayPost-Movie-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor"></a>2. PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 10.3 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App"                ></p><p>This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99.</p><h4 id="3-PicStich"><a href="#3-PicStich" class="headerlink" title="3. PicStich"></a>3. PicStich</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 10.0 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg"                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad"                ></p><p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p><h4 id="4-PhotoGrid-Pic-Collage-Maker"><a href="#4-PhotoGrid-Pic-Collage-Maker" class="headerlink" title="4. PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker"></a>4. PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 10.0 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photogrid-video-pic-editor.jpg"                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad"                ></p><p>If you are looking for an app that lets you create stunning video collages in seconds, you should look no further. PhotoGrid app lets you combine multiple videos within a single frame while offering a plethora of video editing tools you can use to enhance each video in the collage. What’s more, the app features a rich font library, stickers, filters and transitions you can use to make each video collage look more authentic. There are hundreds of available layouts to choose from that let you merge up to fifteen separate video clips and more than 400 backgrounds that can fit almost any style of a video collage. The app’s photo editing features are also remarkable which means that you can use the PhotoGrid app to manipulate images in any way you want.</p><h4 id="5-PhotoVideo-Collage-Maker"><a href="#5-PhotoVideo-Collage-Maker" class="headerlink" title="5. PhotoVideo Collage Maker"></a>5. PhotoVideo Collage Maker</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 9.2 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photovideocollage-maker.jpg"                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad"                ></p><p>Making a new video collage with PhotoVideo Collage Maker is a quick and simple process. You just have to pick a layout, arrange videos by dragging and dropping them to a preferred position and choose a frame for each video. The app features a rich collection frames and textures, and it even lets you use frames with curved edges that help your videos stand out. PhotoVideo Collage Maker enables you to import songs from your iTunes collection and allows you to control the volume of the videos or use the fade-in and fade-out effects. You can also choose if you want all the videos to play simultaneously or one after the other. Unlocking the app’s pro features will cost you $1.99, but making this investment is an excellent idea if you would like to use the PhotoVideo Collage Maker for professional purposes.</p><h4 id="6-PicCollage-Grid-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-PicCollage-Grid-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="6. PicCollage Grid &amp; Video Editor"></a>6. PicCollage Grid &amp; Video Editor</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 10.3 or later</p><p>![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PicCollage-grid-video-editor" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PicCollage-grid-video-editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .jpg)</p><p>iPhone and iPad owners in need of a video collage app that also offers powerful photo editing tools are going to love using the PicCollage Grid &amp; Video Editor app. You can either use templates or create authentic grids on your own to impress your friends on social media. The app’s text editor lets change fonts, pick different text colors or change its alignment, while the cutout mode enables you to remove the background from your photos within seconds. Besides making video collages, you can also use the PicCollage Grid &amp; Video Editor to create animated collages. The only downside is that all photo or video collages you create with the free version of the app are going to be watermarked.</p><h4 id="7-VidStitch-Frames-for-Instagram"><a href="#7-VidStitch-Frames-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="7. VidStitch Frames for Instagram"></a>7. VidStitch Frames for Instagram</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 9.0</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg"                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad"                ></p><p>VidsStitch was designed exclusively for iPhones and iPads, and it works best with the videos captured on these devices. The process of creating a new video collage can be completed in just a few quick steps. You should start by choosing one of the pre-designed frames, then you should just import and arrange your videos within the frame and decide whether you want to post the video collage on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Presentation of the videos you record with your iPhone or iPad is as important as their overall quality. The video collage makers for iOS-based devices provide you with all the tools you’re going to need to create visually dynamic, entertaining and attention-grabbing video collages your followers on social media are going to enjoy watching.

But, when it doesn’t, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.</p><p>Here’s the quick list:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Quit and restart Final Cut Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Check your media</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Delete render files and re-render</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Create a new library</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Create a new user account</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Trash FCP X Preferences</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro</a></li></ul><h4 id="1-Quit-and-restart-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Quit-and-restart-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro"></a>1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro</h4><p>Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png"                      alt="restart fcp" title="restart fcp"                ></p><h4 id="2-Check-your-media"><a href="#2-Check-your-media" class="headerlink" title="2 Check your media"></a>2 Check your media</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png"                      alt="check your media" title="check your media"                ></p><p>Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.</p><p>Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.</p><h4 id="3-Delete-render-files-and-re-render"><a href="#3-Delete-render-files-and-re-render" class="headerlink" title="3 Delete render files and re-render"></a>3 Delete render files and re-render</h4><p>Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File &gt; Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.</p><h4 id="4-Create-a-new-library"><a href="#4-Create-a-new-library" class="headerlink" title="4 Create a new library"></a>4 Create a new library</h4><p>Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn’t work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png"                      alt="Create a new library" title="Create a new library"                ></p><h4 id="5-Create-a-new-user-account"><a href="#5-Create-a-new-user-account" class="headerlink" title="5 Create a new user account"></a>5 Create a new user account</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png"                      alt="Create a new user account" title="Create a new user account"                ></p><p>Open System Preferences &gt; Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can’t access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.</p><h4 id="6-Trash-FCP-X-Preferences"><a href="#6-Trash-FCP-X-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="6 Trash FCP X Preferences"></a>6 Trash FCP X Preferences</h4><p>Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you’ve had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:</p><ul><li>Go to the Finder.</li><li>Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go &gt; Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F; and click Go.)</li><li>Open to the Library &gt; Preferences folder.</li><li>Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist</li><li>Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist</li><li>Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist</li><li>Trash any other files that start with “com.apple.finalcut”.</li><li>Empty the Trash.</li><li>Restart Final Cut Pro X.</li></ul><h4 id="7-Remove-and-reinstall-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#7-Remove-and-reinstall-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro"></a>7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro</h4><p>If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12" >Mac App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>One of these techniques should fix your problem.

Even though you get the same set of features that are found in some of the more expensive software, VN Video Editor is very easy to use. Its interface is clean and simple to navigate.</p><p>This program can be used to keep a copy of your essential home video or as a way to make short films of holidays and special events.

You have the green screen and chrome key option, so you can easily remove and change the background of your videos. You have options for adjusting the keyframe and masking. The support for sharing your videos across different platforms is also there. Overall, you have pretty much everything here that you need to edit your videos.</p><h3 id="Sound-And-Music-Options"><a href="#Sound-And-Music-Options" class="headerlink" title="Sound And Music Options"></a><strong>Sound And Music Options</strong></h3><p>This app allows you to edit the sound of your videos also.

So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Valentine’s-Day-Video-on-Windows-and-Mac"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Valentine’s-Day-Video-on-Windows-and-Mac" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac"></a>How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac</h2><p>There are hundreds of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="1-It-all-starts-with-an-Idea"><a href="#1-It-all-starts-with-an-Idea" class="headerlink" title="1. It all starts with an Idea"></a>1. It all starts with an Idea</h3><p>Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.</p><p>Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.</p><h3 id="2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors"><a href="#2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors"></a>2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors</h3><p>During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora"                ></p><p>Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Color Correction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.</p><h3 id="3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements"><a href="#3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements"></a>3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements</h3><p>Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlay, a filter, or an element <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-Apply-Text-Layers"><a href="#4-Apply-Text-Layers" class="headerlink" title="4. Apply Text Layers"></a>4. Apply Text Layers</h3><p>The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>Once you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert the text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.</p><h3 id="5-Create-the-Soundtrack"><a href="#5-Create-the-Soundtrack" class="headerlink" title="5. Create the Soundtrack"></a>5. Create the Soundtrack</h3><p>Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="add music for valentines video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>You can also use Filmora’s library of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender &amp; Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.</p><h3 id="6-Export-the-Video"><a href="#6-Export-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="6. Export the Video"></a>6. Export the Video</h3><p>When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.</p><h2 id="Creating-Videos-with-Valentine-Video-Maker-for-Android"><a href="#Creating-Videos-with-Valentine-Video-Maker-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android"></a>Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android</h2><p>If you find the process of making a Valentine’s Day video on Mac and Windows computers a bit too technical, then an app like <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sigmaappsolution.valentinevideomaker&hl=en_US&gl=US" >Valentine Video Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that lets you edit photos and videos from your Android phone is the perfect option for you.

Each video greeting you create can be shared on social media with a single tap or sent directly via email. Keep in mind that you must make an in-app purchase in order to be able to save your video greetings to the Photo Gallery.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Making something special for the person you love is going to make this year’s Valentine’s Day a day to remember.

In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p><p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p><h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p><h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. Windows 10 Photos App</h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p><p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p><p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters.

You don’t necessarily have to know a lot about photo or video editing process in order to add a vignette to a picture or adjust its color, brightness or highlights. As a matter of fact, all you need is a great app that lets you emphasize the center of the image and darken its edges. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best vignette apps for iPhones and Android devices that make the vignetting process fun.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Vignette-Apps-in-2024-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-10-Vignette-Apps-in-2024-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>Vignettes can be used to make your selfies look more artistic or to increase the contrast between the edges and the center of a landscape photo. Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which you’d like to add this effect, since the results you’re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.</p><h4 id="1-Apple-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Apple-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Apple Photos App"></a>1. Apple Photos App</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p><p>iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The <strong>Vignette effect</strong> can be accessed from the <strong>Edit Photo menu,</strong> by tapping on the <strong>Adjust button</strong> and then opening the <strong>Add menu</strong> and selecting the effect from the list. The <strong>Auto option</strong> will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the <strong>strength, Softness or Radius</strong> settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignette’s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.</p><h4 id="2-Final-Touch"><a href="#2-Final-Touch" class="headerlink" title="2. Final Touch"></a>2. Final Touch</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $0.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg"                      alt="Vignette Effects app"                ></p><p>When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between <strong>square, ellipse or circle shapes</strong> of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.</p><h4 id="3-Snapseed"><a href="#3-Snapseed" class="headerlink" title="3. Snapseed"></a>3. Snapseed</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Android, <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both <strong>JPEG and RAW</strong> file formats. Tap on the <strong>Pencil icon</strong> to access the app’s <strong>Tool menu</strong>, select the <strong>Vignette option</strong> and then proceed to adjust the <strong>Outer and Inner Brightness</strong> sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and <strong>Center Size option</strong> will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the <strong>Save button</strong> once you’re happy with the results and then hit <strong>Export</strong> to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.</p><h4 id="4-VSCO"><a href="#4-VSCO" class="headerlink" title="4. VSCO"></a>4. VSCO</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but contains in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg"                      alt="Vignette Effects app"                ></p><p>Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by <strong>Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.</strong> Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers <strong>basic vignetting tools</strong>. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.</p><h4 id="5-Afterlight-2"><a href="#5-Afterlight-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Afterlight 2"></a>5. Afterlight 2</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $2.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg"                      alt="Vignette Effects app"                ></p><p>iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as <strong>Curves, Selective Hue&#x2F;Saturation or Clarify</strong> are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the <strong>Adjustment Tools icon</strong> and then <strong>browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option</strong>. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Don’t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an <strong>extension for the Apple Photos App</strong> if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.</p><h4 id="6-PhotoToaster"><a href="#6-PhotoToaster" class="headerlink" title="6. PhotoToaster"></a>6. PhotoToaster</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $2.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg"                      alt="Vignette Effects app"                ></p><p>A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app can’t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in <strong>Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border</strong> categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhone’s camera roll, but you can’t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.</p><h4 id="7-PicsArt-Photo-Editor"><a href="#7-PicsArt-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="7.

The app is also equipped with a rich effects library that contains the Vignette effect you can easily customize and apply to a photo. <strong>Tap on the Effects icon</strong>, <strong>select the Vignette effect from the Fx section and then tap on the Gear icon to customize the effect</strong>. Adjust the <strong>Radius and Fade</strong> sliders before picking the color of the vignette. <strong>Tap on the Checkmark icon to confirm the changes</strong> you’ve made and save the photo. PicsArt is a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts where you can share your works with other users or connect with photographers you like.</p><h4 id="8-EffectsStudio"><a href="#8-EffectsStudio" class="headerlink" title="8.

You just have to import a photo from the camera roll and enter the app’s <strong>Edit mode</strong> to start processing a photo. You can adjust the Vignette effect’s settings, by simply dragging sliders, and all changes you make will be immediately displayed on the screen.

The best part is that you can combine the Vignette effect with other options such as <strong>Contrast, Exposure or Sharpen</strong> to create a visual style you want. Sharing photos on this platform can help you get useful advice from more experienced photographers who can suggest a creative way to use vignettes or any other photo effects.</p><h4 id="10-ToolWiz-Photos"><a href="#10-ToolWiz-Photos" class="headerlink" title="10.

ToolWiz Photos</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but contains in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Android, <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/toolwiz-photos/id1002417201?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This simple photo editing app offers <strong>AI filters</strong>, and effects you can apply to a picture in just a single tap. All effects, including the Vignette effect located in the <strong>Photography menu</strong>, are fully customizable, so you can <strong>adjust the radius or choose where the center of the vignette is going to be</strong>. When done, you just have to tap on the <strong>Checkmark icon</strong> to confirm the changes you made and then proceed to apply an art filter like <strong>Grainy Film or use Fish Eye, Double Exposure or Mirror effects</strong>. The app’s file sharing capabilities could be better since you have to save all the photos you edit to your phone.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they aren’t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos?

Then double click it to set the transition duration freely. As you can see, you can also apply one favorite transition effect to all the clips or let the software randomly add transitions for you. To make your videos more stunning, you can also switch to the “Intro&#x2F;Credit” tab to add different intro&#x2F; credit effect to timeline. To change the effect and text, choose the “Title” function and customize it as you like.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-transition-mac.jpg"                      alt="edit video mac"                ></p><h4 id="3-Save-the-edited-videos"><a href="#3-Save-the-edited-videos" class="headerlink" title="3 Save the edited videos"></a>3 Save the edited videos</h4><p>Click the <strong>EXPORT</strong> button on the primary window to reveal the output window.

They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.</p><h4 id="1-Import-Command"><a href="#1-Import-Command" class="headerlink" title="1.  Import Command"></a>1.  Import Command</h4><p>This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.</p><p>Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-1.jpg"                      alt="Import videos to Adobe Premiere"                ></p><p>This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.</p><h4 id="2-Media-Browser"><a href="#2-Media-Browser" class="headerlink" title="2.  Media Browser"></a>2.  Media Browser</h4><p>Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-2.jpg"                      alt="Import videos to Adobe Premiere"                ></p><p>The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.</p><p>One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.</p><h4 id="File-Types"><a href="#File-Types" class="headerlink" title="File Types"></a>File Types</h4><p>Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.</p><p>There are some exceptions to this, however, despite having a huge number of file types supported natively within Premiere, you will sometimes run into files that are not supported, FLV and MKV files being the most common ones, but this is not the end of the world and there is a simple solution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers an easy way to convert any file you may have into media that Premiere can use quickly and efficiently, and is a great tool to have alongside premiere if you commonly work with multiple file types.</p><h2 id="Exporting"><a href="#Exporting" class="headerlink" title="Exporting"></a>Exporting</h2><p>The ultimate aim of any project is obviously to finish it and let others see the result of your creativity, and that means exporting your work into a format that is suitable for the medium you wish the project to be viewed on. Premiere offers a number of options regarding export, you can select an entire sequence to export as a single file for the web or disc, choose a single frame to post to a website, blog or to distribute through email, you can export just the audio, or just the video from a sequence, and if you have the right hardware, can export directly to tape or disk.</p><p>To export a project that closely matches the original media in quality and frame rates, often called a master copy, is very straightforward in Premiere, with the sequence selected, either in the Timeline Panel or the Project Panel, you simply use the File &gt; Export &gt; Media path :</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-3.jpg"                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"                ></p><p>Which opens the media export dialogue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-4.jpg"                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"                ></p><p>Selecting ‘Match Sequence Settings’ here creates a finished file that matches the quality of the original source media. Then you simply choose a suitable name for the file in the Output Name field, and click export. This creates in essence a digital clone of the sequence, and best practice is to always do this for any project, however, for many projects, this is not necessarily the format you would want the final product to be in, those concentrating on YouTube output, or someone wanting to author a DVD for instance will need other options.</p><p>Thankfully Premiere caters here as well. Instead of selecting the ‘Match Sequence Settings’ within export dialogue, you can click on the ‘Format’ field to change the type of file that is produced. What options here can vary depending on codecs installed, this screenshot shows only those that are included with the product for clarity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-5.jpg"                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"                ></p><p>Depending on which format you choose. The preset below will allow you to choose a wide range of output settings to suit the intended platform. For instance, selecting  format brings up a huge number of presets for various Tablets and Phones, but also for Vimeo and YouTube, which is why it is one of the most common output formats. Here’s a look at some of the presets available from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg"                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"                ></p><p>Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.</p><p>The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications.

You can either use an MP3 file or record your own voice to make the soundtrack for the video. The app offers advanced video recording options, so you can pause and resume shooting at any moment or use the Start Timer option to give yourself time to prepare before the recording starts.

The app’s video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.</p><p>However, the Music Video Maker is primarily a photo editor, which means that it lacks some of the frequently used effects that are commonly used in music videos that are posted on TikTok and other similar platforms. The app contains ads, which can slow you down during the video editing process. Despite all of these downsides, Music Video Maker app still offers powerful tools that enable its users to create music videos quickly.</p><h4 id="7-Fideo-Music-Video-Show"><a href="#7-Fideo-Music-Video-Show" class="headerlink" title="7.
